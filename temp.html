In our constantly connected world, travelers rely on smartphones more than ever to help them shop for travel products and services. Smartphones have only been around since 2007, but their rapid adoption by both consumers and global industries have turned them into indispensable everyday tools while traveling.

<b>Survey Doesn't Define Mobile (no differentiation between apps vs web vs responsive)</b>

Last week, <a href="http://www.sita.aero/" target="_blank">Sita</a> released the results from its <a href="http://www.sita.aero/surveys-reports/industry-surveys-reports/airline-it-trends-survey-2014" target="_blank">Airline Business IT Trends Survey</a>, which is an independent poll of Senior IT personnel working within the top 200 passenger carriers. The respondents together carry more than 50% of the world passenger traffic. While the report shows that airlines are beginning to consider mobile a necessity, the results and subsequent exchanges (and lack of them) with SITA reveal lingering issues within the travel industry when it comes to understanding the complete digital landscape and how to meet Customer needs.

One of the fundamental flaws of the survey and subsequent report is that SITA did not differentiate between mobile website or mobile application (native apps), and there was no mention of responsive design at all. There is already a lively debate across the industry on the value of mobile web versus native applications, and unfortunately the report did nothing to settle this ongoing issue.

Surveys like this from airline industry organizations like SITA, demonstrate a lack of understanding of the complexities of the digital landscape by not differentiating between mobile sites and mobile apps. When asking SITA for clarification on whether the mention of "mobile" in the survey meant mobile website or mobile app, they responded by stating "80% of smart phone use is through apps not mobile web. I think we can assume the ratio is similar with travel companies."

A quick google search and corresponding results will show that the response from SITA was naive and incorrect. According to Google's: <a href="http://ssl.gstatic.com/think/docs/2013-traveler_research-studies.pdf">The 2013 Traveler</a> (PDF), 66% of air travel bookings on a smartphone happen via browser/web and only 51% via app. On tablet, 78% of air travel bookings happen on browser/web and only 42% via app.

<strong>Search is Still Key</strong>
<p>Why is this a big deal? Airlines need to develop stronger digital strategies to reach consumers early in the travel planning process, well before the consideration phase. Search is still a key resource for travelers and the most common starting point for travel planning, making it an essential channel for airlines as well. Airlines who invest heavily in apps and not mobile or responsive sites are missing out on the primary starting point for most trip planning- search. The fact that the SITA survey is focused on apps, sends the wrong message to airlines looking to improve their overall Customer experience across all digital channels, including mobile. Building a mobile app is not the only solution for airlines looking to meet the needs of Customers across multiple devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/toptravel_graphic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-173" src="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/toptravel_graphic1.jpg" alt="top travel sources" width="1918" height="1422" /></a></p>

Search remains key for leisure and business travelers as they seek a variety of content and information online. Research shows that planning a trip, whether it be leisure or business, starts with search primarily on mobile web. Travelers continue to seek value and comparison shop with increasing frequency, which they cannot get from a single airline application.

<strong>Usability Before Promotion</strong>

One of the things we agree with from the SITA survey is the findings related to usability and overall user experience. User experience and usability are key to success with mobile, and airlines are starting to recognize this (95% of airlines are focused on improving usability of mobile apps). This issue was highlighted in the 2013 ATW/SITA Passenger IT Trends Survey which found that "usability issues were the reason the vast majority (78%) of passengers don’t use a mobile phone for travel services." This is also quite ironic because one of the benefits of building an app is that the native framework allows you to completely control the user interface, opposed to mobile web, which has limitations of viewing by browser. Research from Google says much of the same, "Travel brands still deliver subpar mobile experiences."

<a href="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/usability_graphic.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-185" src="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/usability_graphic.jpg" alt="usability mobile sites ux" width="1916" height="1420" /></a>


Ironically, mobile has been a disappointment according to most of the airlines surveyed, with only around 40% of airlines who think mobile services are performing at least "as expected." Another key statistic is that over one-third of airlines aren't actively tracking many of the key performance indicators identified in the survey, such as "cost savings, usage data, download stats, or revenue generation."  It is hard to understand how airlines could have such high expectations when almost all of them agree their mobile experiences (apps) have usability issues and many aren't even tracking key success indicators.

Alarmingly, the strategy for most airlines to boost passenger usage of mobile apps involves "increasing awareness of their mobile services (81%) and adding more services to increase the attractiveness of their mobile apps to passengers." One thing is clear, airlines need to focus less on increasing awareness of their mobile services that have usability issues and instead focus their efforts on making them easier to use and getting appropriate tracking in place to allow them to monitor and measure successes and failures.

<strong>No Mention of Responsive Design</strong>

Completely left out of the SITA survey was any mention of responsive design or similar development techniques. Mashable and Forrester have stated that 2013 could be the "<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/">Year of Responsive Design</a>," yet most of the travel industry, including airlines, seem to be taking a wait and see approach.
<blockquote>"Building apps may seem like the obvious solution. There's no doubt that having mobile apps for the major platforms is better than having no apps at all, and yet how do you build for every app store? Last month, for instance, Mashable was accessed on more than 2,500 different devices. We could certainly build apps to reach a good number of those platforms, but probably not all of them." -Mashable</blockquote>
For those of us who create websites and services, all this leads to a singular conclusion: A million screens have popped up, and we need to build for all of them- just building apps is not a solution. Most experts outside of the travel industry agree, start with responsive design, and then build apps. With Responsive design, you build a website once, and it works seamlessly across thousands of different screens. Thus an airline doesn't need a mobile site and a website, and they don't have to worry about building apps that work on 2500 devices.

The appeal of a single web site is clear. Not only does it mean an airline only has to build one site, it also can add a feature or service one time and have the update appear on all screens, meaning far less maintenance than operating multiple separate sites or apps.

Advocates argue further that responsive sites will inevitably rise in natural search rankings because every page on a responsive site has one URL, not three URLs (desktop site, tablet site, smartphone site), which split the total value or credibility assigned by Google and Bing. This provides a stronger, consolidated target for search engines.

At the time of writing this post, only two airlines have fully responsive websites, including their booking engines- <a href="http://www.swiss.com/ch/en">Swiss</a> and <a href="http://farelysimple.com/2014/05/virgin-america-launches-responsive-site-new-boarding-pass/">Virgin America</a>, so there is very little information to be gained regarding successes and failures of using responsive design for airlines. But outside of the travel industry, 1-800-Contacts Inc. put responsive design to the test. In early 2013, the web-only merchant "pitted its existing smartphone-optimized site against a new responsive design site, splitting mobile traffic between the two. A few months later, the verdict was in: the smartphone site was retired, the responsive site won."
<blockquote>"Conversion rates improved, and we only have to manage one code base and one set of analytics instead of having tags from multiple platforms," says Phil Barrett, senior vice president of e-commerce and mobile. "Mobile is changing so fast that a responsive experience allows us to scale, adopt and convert on all screen sizes and form factors." - <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2014/02/03/challenging-web-design">Internet Retailer</a></blockquote>
As airlines look to expand their eCommerce presence to devices beyond their website, it is imperative that they consider responsive design as part of a healthy digital strategy.  According to SITA, "the ambition of airlines is to make shopping services as widely available on smartphones as on a website. By 2017, around 75% of airlines will have achieved this."

<a href="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-06-at-1.56.55-PM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-198" src="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-06-at-1.56.55-PM.jpg" alt="airline deployment of mobile e-Commerce" /></a>

Currently 37% of ancillary sales come through websites, while 2.4% are via mobile phones. Nevertheless, by 2017, the mobile channel is expected to contribute nearly five times as much, representing 11.6% of total ancillary sales.

<a href="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-06-at-1.57.10-PM2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-200" src="http://travelaersite.dev/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-06-at-1.57.10-PM2.jpg" alt="deployment of mobile self service airlines" /></a>For those airlines playing the wait and see game, they should stop waiting. According to <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/peter_sheldon/13-11-18-rwd_is_a_natural_evolution_of_the_web_and_its_here_to_stay">Forrester Research</a>, "responsive design is a natural evolution of the web and is here to stay."
<blockquote>"When I <a style="color: #3399cc;" href="http://blogs.forrester.com/peter_sheldon/12-07-13-is_responsive_design_the_future_of_cross_touchpoint_web_development">first looked</a> at responsive web design (RWD) back in June 2012, only early adopters (mostly startups, agencies and media firms) had taken the plunge. Back then, developers and web designers alike were still getting to grips with the concepts required to build responsive sites. eBusiness leaders, although intrigued by the premise of a single site able to adapt across devices, were mostly playing a pragmatic wait-and-see game. Fast forward almost 18 months and much has changed. Although hype and confusion continue (not least due to a perplexing set of technology terms and marketing buzzwords), RWD has firmly cemented itself as a natural evolution of web, and it’s here to stay." -<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/peter_sheldon/13-11-18-rwd_is_a_natural_evolution_of_the_web_and_its_here_to_stay">Peter Sheldon, Forrester</a></blockquote>
Instead of airlines complicating their digital experience by adding more functionality and services to mobile apps, they should instead convert their existing sites into responsively designed sites. It may be a much larger project than building a stand alone native app, but in the long run the airline will reach more Customers and decrease the amount of maintenance that is needed for their web properties.

We are hoping that airlines will take the advice of many including <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/03/26/why-you-need-to-prioritize-responsive-design-right-now/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> in 2014 and invest in responsive design:
<blockquote>"One thing is certain, you don’t want to fall behind and watch your competitors launch responsive websites while yours is still stuck in 2010 (or earlier). The time to get responsive with your web design is now."</blockquote>
We are also hopeful that travel industry organizations like SITA will start to place an emphasis on differentiation when talking about mobile.
