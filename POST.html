Congrats to <a href="http://www.virginamerica.com/" target="_blank">Virgin America</a> on the launch of their <a href="https://beta.virginamerica.com/" target="_blank">new responsive website</a> - only the 2nd major airline to launch a fully responsive site. The first airline to launch a responsive site was <a href="http://www.swiss.com/ch/en">Swiss</a>, only a few weeks back. Virgin America has also launched a nifty <a href="http://static.virginamerica.com/Web3/newlookvx/vx-redesign-9/7/index.html" target="_blank">"how it works"</a> site to explain their thinking behind the redesign and the core principles that they believe create a better Customer experience. According to Virgin America the goal of the redesign was to make for a faster, smoother and more intuitive booking experience - whether guests are on a laptop, tablet or smartphone.
<blockquote>We wanted to create a fresh, new online face for Virgin America that better reflects the design-driven, tech-forward experience guests find onboard our planes. The responsive design-based site will offer a faster, smoother and more intuitive booking experience – whether guests are visiting virginamerica.com from a laptop, a tablet or a smartphone.</blockquote>
So far the reviews from Customers and industry experts are mixed:
<blockquote>
<p>This is <i>slick</i>.Virgin has been my favorite airline for some time, but now just went up 3.14 notches."  Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7790716">YCombinator</a></p>
<p>From a design perspective this is one of the most beautiful airline booking designs I've ever seen, but from a usability perspective it might just be the worst (save for maybe RyanAir).” Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7790716">YCombinator</a></p>
<p>“Overall I think it's a good start but hardly production ready. My gut instinct is that most people will be impressed by how "pretty" it is, but that the overall conversion rates will decrease significantly.” Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7790716">YCombinator</a></p>
<p>“I think they took "mobile first" to the extreme, and disregarded desktop. I imagine that giant calendar is pretty cool on an iPad. It's not really responsive design if you optimize only for devices and not for desktop as well.” Source: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7790716">YCombinator</a></p>
